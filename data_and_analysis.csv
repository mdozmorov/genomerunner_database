Mitranscriptome,http://mitranscriptome.org/,"MiTranscriptome is a catalog of human long poly-adenylated RNA transcripts derived from computational analysis of high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data from over 6,500 samples spanning diverse cancer and tissue types. The complete catalog contains over 91,000 genes, the majority of which are previously uncharacterized long RNAs. Gene expression analysis of the transcripts revealed numerous cancer-specific and lineage-specific RNAs. We aim to enable the scientific community to investigate these intriguing transcripts in further detail.",Yes,,One big track. Can be used for epigenomic- and annotation enrichment analyses
